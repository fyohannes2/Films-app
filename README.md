# What did I learn?
How to use Next.js framework with React to build a CRUD application.

# Biggest challenge:
1. Deployment to Netlify and control flow with github.
2. Trying to figure out Next.js.
3. Trying to understand how different packages.
4. Salvaging project after breaking it.
5. Did I mention deployment?

# Future ideas:
Better styling and providing users in the community to add media and blog posts. No commenting due to the polarity of opinions on this topic, admin regulations may need to be enforced frequently. Maintain neutral platform thats informational not so much promotional are persuanding. A news tracker on the updates and trends in the culture of health and wellness via natural remedies as well as the legality status updates globally.
